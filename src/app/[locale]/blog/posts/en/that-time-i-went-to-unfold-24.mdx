# What is Unfold?

Unfold is a 36-hour hackathon organized by CoinDCX, one of India's leading cryptocurrency exchanges. 
The event brings together developers, designers, and entrepreneurs to collaborate on innovative projects in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. 
Participants have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge technologies, network with industry experts, and showcase their skills.

## My Experience at Unfold

This was my first time attending Unfold, and it was an incredible experience. The event was held at the Marriot in Bangalore. 
From the moment I arrived, I was surrounded by like-minded individuals who were passionate about web3 and the chain.

I had the pleasure of working with <Mention name="Vinay Rajan" href="https://x.com/VinayRajanS" />, <Mention name="Rishi V" href="https://github.com/risv1" />, and <Mention name="Prasanjit Panda" href="https://github.com/Prasanjit-4" />.
We had a great time together and had lots of fun working together on things.

## Day 1: Introduction to the problem statement and first steps

So on day 1, I arrived at the venue around 9ish from the metro and met up with my team. We then proceeded to the checkin where we got our tickets checked and our wristbands.
After that, we went to the main hall where the event was being held. While most people had already assembled, we were a bit late and I personally did not attend and was instead much more enamoured by the wonderful and premium quality tea and biscuits stalls (I had quite a bit of them ðŸ˜‰ ). 
They came in many varities and were present all throughout the hotel.

After we got our problem statement (pj went and inquired about it), we started brainstorming ideas. We had a few ideas but we finally settled on building multiple things. 

The project that i was working on was a Dapp for telegram. 
It was a simple PokemonGO style game where users would download the app (vite+ts) through telegram mini apps and then based on a minting logic, the ap would request the user's location and it would setup a grid and certain grids would have a reward. If the user moves to the grid which has the reward, they would've _found waldo_.
The reward would be an NFT which would be minted on the aptos chain (devnet). 

We spent most of this day just throwing ideas at each other, having fun and eating good food.

We then headed back to our rooms after dinner to start with the next sprint of the project. Here we spent a lot of time helping the others debug, setting up frontends and backends and just generally having fun.
We also had alot of iconic moments like the one below.

## Day 2: Coding, Submission and Presentation

So after a gruelling night of coding non-stop, we finally managed to get two projects done. We submitted them and then proceeded to get lunch

Now that the projects were submitted, we had a lot of time to kill, we spent most of it exploring the place, having tea and biscuits, networking and also collecting alot of swag. we got t-shirts, stickers, hoodies, bags, plushies, hats, etc.

finally after our presentations, we waited for the results.

After a long wait, the results were announced. We did not win any prizes but we got a good overall place.
But the experience was worth more than any prize. I got to learn a lot of new things, meet new people and also have fun.
