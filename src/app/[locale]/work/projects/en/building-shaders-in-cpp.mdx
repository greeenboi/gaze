# GPU Shaders Demo

A demonstration project for learning and experimenting with GPU shaders using OpenGL. This project provides simple examples to understand how to implement and use shaders in graphics programming.

## Overview

This project showcases various shader implementations using OpenGL, GLEW, and GLFW. Each example demonstrates different aspects of shader programming, starting with basic concepts like rendering a simple triangle.

## Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you'll need:

- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake (minimum 3.10)
- OpenGL (3.3+)
- GLEW (OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library)
- GLFW3 (Graphics Library Framework)

### Installing dependencies

#### Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake libglew-dev libglfw3-dev
```

#### macOS:
```bash
brew install cmake glew glfw
```

#### Windows:
It's recommended to use vcpkg or similar package managers:
```bash
vcpkg install glew glfw3
```

## Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/greeenboi/gpu-shaders-demo.git
cd gpu-shaders-demo
```

2. Create and navigate to build directory:
```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
```

3. Generate build files with CMake:
```bash
cmake ..
```

4. Build the project:
```bash
make
```

## Running Examples

The project includes several examples, each demonstrating different shader techniques:

### Triangle Example
A simple example showing a colored triangle rendered with basic vertex and fragment shaders.

To run this example:
```bash
./triangle
```

This example demonstrates:
- Setting up an OpenGL context with GLFW
- Compiling and linking vertex and fragment shaders
- Creating and using vertex buffer objects (VBO) and vertex array objects (VAO)
- Drawing a basic shape with a solid color

## Project Structure

```
gpu-shaders-demo/
├── CMakeLists.txt       # Project configuration and build settings
├── examples/            # Contains individual example programs
│   └── triangle.cpp     # Basic triangle rendering example
├── shaders/             # GLSL shader files (copied to build directory at compile time)
└── src/                 # Main source code
    └── main.cpp         # Simple menu program listing available examples
```

## Controls

- Press `ESC` to close any example window
- Window can be resized, and the viewport will adjust accordingly

## Adding New Examples

To add a new example:

1. Create a new .cpp file in the `examples/` directory
2. Add the example to `CMakeLists.txt` using the `add_example()` function
3. If needed, add any shader files to the `shaders/` directory
