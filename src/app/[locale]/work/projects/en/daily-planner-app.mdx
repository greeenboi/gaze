# Daily Planner

## Introduction
Daily Planner is an Expo (React Native) application that lets a signed-in user create, view and manage scheduled tasks with time ranges, optional reminders, repetition rules and tagging. Authentication is handled through Better Auth with a Prisma-backed data store. The same codebase serves API routes (for auth and tasks) and the mobile/web client. Local SQLite (via Prisma) is used in development; a LibSQL/Turso database can be enabled in production through environment variables.

## Features
- User authentication (email and password) via Better Auth
- Session handling using secure tokens or cookies (API routes)
- Create, read and update tasks with start and end timestamps
- Support for allâ€‘day tasks and status (pending, in progress, completed, canceled)
- Task priority levels and optional color labeling
- Reminders with configurable minute offsets and delivery method placeholder fields
- Basic recurrence support through repeat rules (frequency, interval, until, count)
- Tagging system (userâ€‘scoped tags) and participant relationships
- Simple tasks API (fetch by date, create, update) under <InlineCode>app/api/tasks</InlineCode>
- React Native UI components styled with NativeWind and Gluestack UI
- Environmentâ€‘driven selection between local SQLite and LibSQL adapter

> NOTE

> Current master branch may have breaking changes detach to commit <InlineCode>9ec40a5a5ea77994056dc451c0533baec95e249e</InlineCode> when working / using the app

## TODO

The current app structure acts as a monorepo to bundle the server into a web compoenent outside of expo's android/ios build. The problem is that prisma depends on <InlineCode>node:fs</InlineCode> runtime which is not currently supported in [EAS hosting](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/hosting/reference/worker-runtime/#nodejs-compatibility), As a result I have to refactor the whole thing to a cloud build which does not depend on <InlineCode>node:fs</InlineCode>. I have tried uploading the <InlineCode>dist</InlineCode> to netlify, hosting on vercel, and even switching to turso + libsql for an entire overhaul on the system. All current implementations just point to use a different backend schema that does not depend on prisma.
So i will have to do:

<Checkbox
  label="Remove prisma implementation"
/>
<Checkbox
  label="check expo-sqlite feasability for better-auth"
/>
<Checkbox
  label="Refactor backend to make calls to server (hono-ts) if expo-sqlite does not work out"
/>
<Checkbox
  label="Refactor logic to work on only cloud / only local build based on option 2"
/>

## ðŸš€ How to use

<CodeBlock
  className="my-24"
  codeInstances={[
    {
      code: `npx prisma generate`,
      label: 'Generate Prisma Client',
      language: 'bash'
    },
    {
      code: `npx expo start`,
      label: 'Start the server',
      language: 'bash'
    }    
  ]}
  copyButton
/>


For a production deployment set the following (example for Turso / LibSQL):

```
TURSO_DATABASE_URL=... # only on the server host
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=...   # only on the server host
EXPO_PUBLIC_AUTH_BASE_URL=https://your-production-domain
```

Then run migrations against the remote database:

<CodeBlock
  className="my-24"
  compact
  codeInstances={[
    {
      code: `npx prisma migrate deploy`,
      label: 'Download the gem',
      language: 'bash'
    }
  ]}
  copyButton
/>

The mobile client will talk to the deployed API at <InlineCode>EXPO_PUBLIC_AUTH_BASE_URL/api/auth</InlineCode> and <InlineCode>.../api/tasks</InlineCode>.
