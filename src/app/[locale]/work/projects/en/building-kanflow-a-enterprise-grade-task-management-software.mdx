## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was implementing the offline only database that can be embedded within the app. 
We had to ensure that the data was stored securely and that the app could handle large amounts of data without slowing down.
We first went with the built in tauri's postgres plugin but it was not stable during builds. 
So we then switched to pglite by ElectricSql. Unfortunatly I was unable to get the storage permissions to work on windows since it is a transient db. 
So I had to switch to sqlite3 which was a bit more stable and had better support for cross platform. And I had to setup a very complicated migration and schema to get Auth, Anon Auth and User state management to work perfectly.
